                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>Park Circus Dream House may only have formed in May 2025, but it was percolating long before that - I've been renovating properties since I bought my first flat in 2015, and my first client as Park Circus Dream House was my tenth project overall. Over the past decade, I have completed a mixture of commercial and residential projects, ranging from one-bedroom flats to three-bedroom houses, a cafe and a large office.</p>

                        <p>I have hosted on Airbnb, sublet my cafe to other business owners for cocktail and supper club nights, and rented our home on Scouty for film and photo shoots.</p>

                        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                        <p>I definitely have a type when it comes to buildings; I love original features and a non-linear or challenging layout to get my teeth into. I love listed buildings and we've lived in several, relishing the extra challenges they bring to a renovation.</p>

                        <p>I have a great track record of adding significant value to properties through clever changes to layout and cosmetic improvements, but I am primarily committed to <strong>letting your home reflect your personality and interests</strong>, rather than just existing as an investment vehicle.</p>

                        <p><em>Every room should tell a story, and the design should both reflect and support your life.</em> If it can also bring the home comforts of a luxurious hotel stay, so much the better.</p>
